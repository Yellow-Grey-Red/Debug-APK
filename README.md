# Debug-APK
反编译，编译，签名，安装，运行，卸载apk，执行命令，自带adb。
这个软件没有太大的意义，他仅仅是为了满足我前段时间解包第三方apk的需求。

使用场景：
需要频繁的编译，签名apk并运行。如果你需要频繁的插入相同的代码，你可以在jetbrain市场里面试试我写的插件Template，图标是个绿色枫叶，这个也是为了满足当时频繁插入代码写的。

如果你觉得界面很丑，审美有问题，请包容一些，因为我的大学老师也是这样认为的，我已经很努力了。


about apk：Decompile，compile，signer，install，run，uninstall，exec command and without user adb.
This software doesn't serve much practical purpose; it was merely developed to meet my recent need of unpacking third-party APKs.

Use Case:
It is designed for frequent APK compilation, signing and execution. If you need to repeatedly insert the same code snippets, you can try the plugin I developed called Template on the JetBrains Marketplace—it has a green maple leaf icon. I originally created this plugin to streamline the process of frequent code insertion as well.


If you find the interface unattractive or think the design is not to your taste, please be a little tolerant. After all, even my university teacher thought the same way, and I’ve already tried my very best.
